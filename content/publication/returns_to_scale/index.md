abstract: We estimate returns to scale in the U.K. economy from 1998 - 2014. We show that across firms productivity and returns to scale are negatively related, and overall returns to scale have increased whilst productivity has declined. To reconcile these empirical results, we develop a heterogeneous firm dynamics model with endogenous returns to scale. Our main result is that rising returns to scale in variable production, as opposed to changing fixed costs, can cause returns to scale to increase whilst productivity declines. The mechanism relies on greater increasing returns in variable production weakening firm selection, which allows low-productivity firms to survive. The same would not hold if returns to scale were driven by rising fixed cost. Overall the results suggest that changing marginal costs, rather than fixed costs, explain the puzzle of rising returns to scale but weak productivity in several advanced economies.
