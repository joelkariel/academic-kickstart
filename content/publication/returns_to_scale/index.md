abstract: We estimate returns to scale in the U.K. economy from 1998 - 2014 and show that returns to scale have increased over time. We show that there is a positive relationship between returns to scale and productivity across industries. However, within industries, there is a negative relationship. We reconcile these results in a firm dynamics model with endogenous returns to scale. Higher fixed-costs lead to higher returns to scale and selection of higher-productivity firms. However, high-productivity firms are large, and make greater use of their fixed costs which endogenously reduces returns to scale.
