I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Kent](https://www.kent.ac.uk/economics) working with [Anthony Savagar](https://www.asavagar.com/) on scale economies in the UK. I completed my DPhil in Economics at the [University of Oxford](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [Petr Sedlacek](https://users.ox.ac.uk/~econ0506/). My doctoral research explored the impact of new technologies - such as Artificial Intelligence and Robots - on the macroeconomy. My subsequent research has focused on measuring returns to scale in the UK, understanding its relationship with productivity, and working with heterogeneous firm models. I am in the early stages of various projects on `green technologies': looking at their adoption, relationship with climate policy, and impact on firms.

I was awarded BA Leverhulme Small Research Grant 2022. I am working on [racial discrimination]({{< relref "/publication/discrimination_football" >}}) in the labour market for professional footballers with an RA. {{% staticref "uploads/RA_job_advert.pdf" "newtab" %}}The job advert can be found here{{% /staticref %}}. Initial findings will be available in early 2023.

I am on the academic job market 2022/23.
