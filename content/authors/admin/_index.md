I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Kent [https://www.kent.ac.uk/economics] working with Anthony Savagar [https://www.asavagar.com/] on scale economies in the UK. I completed by DPhil in Economics at the University of Oxford [https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/] under the supverision of Petr Sedlacek [https://users.ox.ac.uk/~econ0506/]. My doctoral research explored the impact of new technologies - such as Artificial Intelligence and Robots - on the macroeconomy.
